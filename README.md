Hi, my name is Angelo Muller and I am a Cyber Security student based in Melbourne, Australia. As an aspiring Cyber Security professional and active learner, I thought it'll be interesting to display here my journey as I explore and sharpen my knowledge of day-to-day tools and methods as I go. The intention is to be more on a Blue team's tools oriented side of things - SIEM's, IDS's, IPS's and on -  which is where my main interests are, however I might share some labs involving different domains of cyber security as well.
Please feel free to reach out to me regarding any content on this page or simply have a chat, I'm always open for different approaches and POV'S!
