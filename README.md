Hi, my name is Angelo Muller and I am an Cyber Security student based in Melbourne, Australia. As an aspiring Cyber Security professional and active learner, I thought it'll be interesting to display here my journey as I explore and sharpen my knowledge of day-to-day tools and methods as I go. The intention is to be more on a Blue team's tools oriented side of things - SIEM's, IDS's, IPS's and on -  which is where my main interests are. For those new to this area, blue team are security professionals focused in protecting digital enviroments, wheter red teams have their focus on finding vulnerabilities and tesing systems for breaches.
Please feel free to engage and reach out with any content you find in this page, I'd highly appreciate your input and point of view!
